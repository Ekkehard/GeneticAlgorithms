# GeneticAlgorithms
Class to implement a set of Genetic Algorithms using genes taking on values of 
settable alphabets (alleles) to form chromosomes which then are used to optimize
parameters of an arbitrary objective function employing procedures from
biologic evolution, i.e. "selective mating," "crossover," "mutation,"
"selection of the fittest," and "inversion."
