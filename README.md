# GeneticAlgorithms
Class to implement Genetic Algorithms using genes taking on values of settable
alphabets (alleles) to form chromosomes which then are used to optimize
parameters of an arbitrary objective function employing procedures from
biologic evolution, i.e. "selective mating," "crossover," "mutation,"
"selection of the fittest," and "inversion."
